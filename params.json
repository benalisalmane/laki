You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.\r\n\r\nMaking a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io>\r\n\r\n> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:\r\n\r\n> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).\r\n> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.\r\n> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n![_config.yml](/images/config.png \"_config.yml\")\r\n  \r\n### Step 3) Publish your first blog post\r\n\r\nEdit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy.\r\n\r\n![First Post](/images/first-post.png \"First Post\")\r\n\r\n> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## Moar!\r\n\r\nI've created a more detailed walkthrough of [**Getting Started With Jekyll**](#), check it out if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough and some background on Jekyll. :metal:\r\n\r\nIt covers:\r\n\r\n- A more detailed walkthrough of setting up your Jekyll blog\r\n- Common issues that you might encounter while using Jekyll\r\n- Importing from Wordpress, using your own domain name, and blogging in your favorite editor\r\n- Theming in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples\r\n- A quick look at Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass/Coffeescript support and Collections\r\n\r\n## Jekyll Now Features\r\n\r\n✓ Command-line free _fork-first workflow_, using GitHub.com to create, customize and post to your blog  \r\n✓ Fully responsive and mobile optimized base theme (**[Theme Demo](http://jekyllnow.com)**)  \r\n✓ Sass/Coffeescript support using Jekyll 2.0  \r\n✓ Free hosting on your GitHub Pages user site  \r\n✓ Markdown blogging  \r\n✓ Syntax highlighting  \r\n✓ Disqus commenting  \r\n✓ Google Analytics integration  \r\n✓ SVG social icons for your footer  \r\n✓ 3 http requests, including your avatar  \r\n✓ Emoji in blog posts! :sparkling_heart: :sparkling_heart: :sparkling_heart:  \r\n\r\n✘ No installing dependancies  \r\n✘ No need to set up local development  \r\n✘ No configuring plugins  \r\n✘ No need to spend time on theming  \r\n✘ More time to code other things ... wait ✓!  \r\n\r\n## Questions?\r\n\r\n[Open an Issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) and let's chat!\r\n\r\n## Get my new themes\r\n\r\nIf you'd like me to let you know when I release a new theme, just [drop me your email for updates](http://getresponse.com).
